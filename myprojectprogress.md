I'm a fan of the common repository structure. Submitty is an example of this where theres one main repo (technically a project of repos). If someone wants to add a new feature/bugfix/whatever than the repo is cloned and the work is done in a branch and merged back into master if approved. I also think working with branches is easier when its cloned instead of forked. 

On [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows) theres a Dictator and Lieutenants Workflow where there are are developers work is reviews and merged by lieutenants and then a dictator merges their work. This model is interesting because it seems a lot more organized and structured but I think is really important for big projects like Linux. Setting this infrastructure for a smaller project probably wouldn't make sense.
